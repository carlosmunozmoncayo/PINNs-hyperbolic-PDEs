# PINNs-hyperbolic-PDEs
Simple implementation of Physics Informed Neural Networks for some systems of hyperbolic PDEs using **Pytorch**

## Currently implemented systems:
- 1D Inviscid Burgers' equation
- 1D Shallow Water Equations with flat bottom

-------------------------------------------
## Requirements
My specific setup is provided in the file **requirements.txt**, but the following Python libraries are required
- NumPy 
- Matplotlib
- PyTorch
- pyDOE
- scipy
- Jupyter Notebook
- CLAWPACK (If you want to set up a custom problem, data is provided for each system otherwise)
